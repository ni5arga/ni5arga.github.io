## Welcome, friend

### :purple_heart: :earth_africa: :purple_heart:

Heya! I'm Nisarga - a passionate software engineer and hacker from India fueled by caffiene. I love to build new stuff, hack around and break things. I sometimes research and study about cybersecurity out of curiosity and interest. Nowadays, my interest mostly lies in topics like backend development, pentesting, OSINT, malware-dev, reverse engineering and automation. 

This is a place where I share my thoughts, writeups and other random stuff.
